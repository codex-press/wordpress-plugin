Create stub posts for articles on the Codex Press publishing platform.

== Description ==

Codex Press is a cloud-hosted platform for creating multimedia articles with
unique design elements. This plugin provides a mechanism for easily importing
Codex Press articles to stub posts in your blog. 

The plugin also whitelists Codex Press as an oEmbed provider so that you can
embed Codex Press articles in the middle of other posts just as you would
other sources such as YouTube.
